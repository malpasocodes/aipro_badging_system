# Phase 4 Plan: Roles & Approvals Queue

**Project:** AIPPRO Badging System
**Phase:** 4 of 10
**Status:** DRAFT - Pending Approval
**Created:** September 30, 2025
**Author:** Alfred Essa (with Claude Code)

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 4 implements the **Roles & Approvals Queue** system - the foundation for badge request management and role-based workflows. This phase will enable students to request mini-badges (placeholder UI for now), assistants and admins to review pending requests in an approval queue, and establish the audit trail for all approval decisions.

This is a critical phase that establishes the workflow infrastructure for the badge system. While the full badge catalog (programs, skills, mini-badges) won't be implemented until Phase 5, we'll create the request/approval pipeline and placeholder UI that will integrate with the catalog later.

---

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Implement request submission flow** - Students can submit badge requests (with placeholder badge selection)
2. **Build approval queue UI** - Admins and assistants can view, filter, and manage pending requests
3. **Create decision workflow** - Approve/reject requests with reasons and audit trails
4. **Establish RBAC enforcement** - Server-side role checks for all privileged operations
5. **Audit logging** - Complete audit trail for all approval decisions

### Success Criteria
- Students can submit requests and see their status
- Assistants can approve/reject requests with reasons
- Admins have full approval permissions plus visibility into all decisions
- All approval actions are logged to audit_logs table
- Role enforcement prevents unauthorized actions
- Approval queue supports filtering and pagination
- Average time to process a request < 5 minutes (manual review time)

---

## Approach

### Architecture & Design Patterns

**Service Layer Pattern:**
- `RequestService`: Handles request submission, retrieval, and decision logic
- `AuditService`: Centralized audit logging for all privileged operations
- `RosterService`: User management for admins/assistants (view users, update roles)

**Data Access Layer:**
- `RequestRepository`: CRUD operations for requests table
- `AuditRepository`: Append-only audit log operations
- `UserRepository`: Enhanced user queries (roster views, role filtering)

**UI Components:**
- `app/ui/request_form.py`: Badge request submission form (student-facing)
- `app/ui/approval_queue.py`: Approval queue table with filters (admin/assistant)
- `app/ui/roster.py`: User roster management (admin/assistant)

**Role-Based Routing:**
- Extend existing dashboards (admin.py, assistant.py, student.py) with real functionality
- Shared approval queue component for both admin and assistant roles
- Role guards on all service methods

### Database Schema

**New Tables:**

```sql
-- Badge requests table
CREATE TABLE requests (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    mini_badge_id UUID NOT NULL,  -- FK to mini_badges (Phase 5), nullable for now
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',  -- pending, approved, rejected
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    decided_at TIMESTAMP,
    decided_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),  -- Admin or assistant who made decision
    decision_reason TEXT,  -- Optional reason for approve/reject
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),

    CONSTRAINT chk_status CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected'))
);

CREATE INDEX idx_requests_user_id ON requests(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_requests_status ON requests(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_requests_status_submitted ON requests(status, submitted_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_requests_decided_by ON requests(decided_by);

-- Audit logs table
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    actor_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),  -- User performing the action
    action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,  -- approve_request, reject_request, update_role, etc.
    entity VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- request, user, etc.
    entity_id UUID NOT NULL,  -- ID of the entity being acted upon
    metadata JSONB,  -- Additional context (old values, reasons, etc.)
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_created_at ON audit_logs(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_actor ON audit_logs(actor_user_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_entity ON audit_logs(entity, entity_id);
```

**Notes:**
- `mini_badge_id` will be NULL/placeholder in Phase 4 (we'll use a dummy "test badge" approach)
- Full foreign key constraint to `mini_badges` table will be added in Phase 5
- `metadata` JSONB column allows flexible audit context without schema changes

### Business Rules

1. **Request Submission:**
   - Only students can submit requests
   - Cannot submit duplicate pending requests for same badge
   - Request immediately gets status='pending'

2. **Approval/Rejection:**
   - Only admins and assistants can approve/reject
   - Cannot modify request after decision (status changes from pending → approved/rejected are final)
   - Decision reason is optional for approvals, encouraged for rejections
   - Decided_by and decided_at are automatically set

3. **Audit Trail:**
   - Every approve/reject action creates audit log entry
   - Audit logs are append-only (no updates or deletes)
   - Metadata includes: request_id, decision, reason, previous_status

4. **Role Permissions:**
   - **Students**: Submit requests, view own requests
   - **Assistants**: View all requests, approve/reject, view roster (read-only)
   - **Admins**: All assistant permissions + update roles, full roster management

---

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Database Models (app/models/)

**Files to Create:**
- `app/models/request.py` - Request model with status enum
- `app/models/audit_log.py` - AuditLog model with JSONB metadata
- `app/models/__init__.py` - Export new models

**Request Model:**
```python
from enum import Enum
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional
from uuid import UUID, uuid4
from sqlmodel import Field, SQLModel

class RequestStatus(str, Enum):
    PENDING = "pending"
    APPROVED = "approved"
    REJECTED = "rejected"

class Request(SQLModel, table=True):
    __tablename__ = "requests"

    id: UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid4, primary_key=True)
    user_id: UUID = Field(foreign_key="users.id", index=True)
    mini_badge_id: Optional[UUID] = Field(default=None)  # Placeholder for Phase 4
    status: RequestStatus = Field(default=RequestStatus.PENDING)
    submitted_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    decided_at: Optional[datetime] = Field(default=None)
    decided_by: Optional[UUID] = Field(default=None, foreign_key="users.id")
    decision_reason: Optional[str] = Field(default=None)
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
```

**AuditLog Model:**
```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any
from uuid import UUID, uuid4
from sqlmodel import Field, SQLModel, Column
from sqlalchemy import JSON

class AuditLog(SQLModel, table=True):
    __tablename__ = "audit_logs"

    id: UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid4, primary_key=True)
    actor_user_id: Optional[UUID] = Field(default=None, foreign_key="users.id")
    action: str = Field(max_length=100)
    entity: str = Field(max_length=50)
    entity_id: UUID
    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(default=None, sa_column=Column(JSON))
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
```

### Step 2: Database Migration

**Migration Tasks:**
- Create Alembic migration for `requests` table
- Create Alembic migration for `audit_logs` table
- Add indexes as specified above
- Test migration up/down (reversibility)

**Commands:**
```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add requests table for badge approval workflow"
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add audit_logs table for privileged action tracking"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

### Step 3: Service Layer (app/services/)

**Files to Create:**
- `app/services/request_service.py` - Request submission and decision logic
- `app/services/audit_service.py` - Centralized audit logging
- `app/services/roster_service.py` - User roster management
- `app/services/__init__.py` - Export services

**RequestService Interface:**
```python
class RequestService:
    def submit_request(self, user_id: UUID, badge_name: str) -> Request
    def get_user_requests(self, user_id: UUID, status_filter: Optional[RequestStatus] = None) -> List[Request]
    def get_pending_requests(self, limit: int = 25, offset: int = 0) -> List[Request]
    def get_request_by_id(self, request_id: UUID) -> Optional[Request]
    def approve_request(self, request_id: UUID, approver_id: UUID, reason: Optional[str] = None) -> Request
    def reject_request(self, request_id: UUID, approver_id: UUID, reason: str) -> Request
    def count_pending_requests(self) -> int
```

**AuditService Interface:**
```python
class AuditService:
    def log_action(
        self,
        actor_user_id: UUID,
        action: str,
        entity: str,
        entity_id: UUID,
        metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    ) -> AuditLog
    def get_audit_logs(
        self,
        entity: Optional[str] = None,
        entity_id: Optional[UUID] = None,
        actor_user_id: Optional[UUID] = None,
        limit: int = 100
    ) -> List[AuditLog]
```

**RosterService Interface:**
```python
class RosterService:
    def get_all_users(self, role_filter: Optional[UserRole] = None) -> List[User]
    def get_user_stats(self) -> Dict[str, int]  # Count by role
    def update_user_role(self, user_id: UUID, new_role: UserRole, actor_id: UUID) -> User
    # Phase 4: Read-only for assistants, write for admins only
```

**Role Enforcement:**
- Use decorators or explicit checks in service methods
- Example: `@require_roles(UserRole.ADMIN, UserRole.ASSISTANT)` for approve/reject
- Students can only submit and view their own requests

### Step 4: UI Components (app/ui/)

**Files to Create:**
- `app/ui/request_form.py` - Badge request submission form
- `app/ui/approval_queue.py` - Approval queue table with filters
- `app/ui/roster.py` - User roster view
- `app/ui/__init__.py` - Export UI components

**Request Form (Student):**
- Simple form with badge name text input (placeholder)
- Submit button creates request with status='pending'
- Show success message with request ID
- Display user's request history below form

**Approval Queue (Admin/Assistant):**
- Data table with columns: Student, Badge Name, Submitted At, Status, Actions
- Filter by status (pending/approved/rejected)
- Sort by submission date (newest first)
- Pagination (25 requests per page)
- Action buttons: Approve, Reject (with reason modal)
- Show decided_by and decided_at for completed requests

**Roster View (Admin/Assistant):**
- Data table with columns: Username, Email, Role, Onboarded, Last Login, Actions
- Filter by role
- Admins can update roles (not assistants)
- Show user statistics (count by role)

### Step 5: Dashboard Integration (app/routers/)

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/routers/student.py` - Add request form and request history
- `app/routers/assistant.py` - Add approval queue and roster (read-only)
- `app/routers/admin.py` - Add approval queue, roster (with role management)

**Student Dashboard Updates:**
```python
def render_student_dashboard(user: User) -> None:
    st.markdown("## 🎓 Student Dashboard")
    st.markdown(f"Welcome back, **{user.username or user.email}**!")

    # Badge Request Form
    with st.expander("📝 Request a Badge", expanded=False):
        render_request_form(user)

    # My Requests
    with st.expander("📋 My Badge Requests", expanded=True):
        render_user_requests(user)

    # My Badges (placeholder for Phase 6)
    with st.expander("🏆 My Badges", expanded=False):
        st.info("**Coming in Phase 6**: View your earned badges")
```

**Assistant/Admin Dashboard Updates:**
```python
def render_assistant_dashboard(user: User) -> None:
    st.markdown("## 🎯 Assistant Dashboard")

    # Pending count badge
    pending_count = get_pending_count()
    st.metric("Pending Requests", pending_count)

    # Approval Queue
    with st.expander("📋 Badge Approval Queue", expanded=True):
        render_approval_queue(user, can_edit_roles=False)

    # Roster
    with st.expander("👥 Student Roster", expanded=False):
        render_roster(user, can_edit_roles=False)
```

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Placeholder Badge Selection
**Risk:** Students need to request "something" but full badge catalog doesn't exist yet
**Impact:** Medium - Could create confusion or require rework in Phase 5
**Mitigation:**
- Use a simple text input for "badge name" in Phase 4
- Store badge name as a string in a temporary field
- Plan migration strategy for Phase 5 to populate mini_badge_id from badge names
- Document clearly in UI that this is temporary/placeholder

### Risk 2: Audit Log Metadata Schema Flexibility
**Risk:** JSONB metadata could become unstructured and hard to query
**Impact:** Medium - Could make audit analysis difficult later
**Mitigation:**
- Define clear metadata schemas for each action type in service layer
- Use TypedDict for metadata structures
- Add helper methods for common audit queries
- Document metadata schema in code comments

### Risk 3: Role Enforcement Complexity
**Risk:** Missing role checks could allow unauthorized actions
**Impact:** High - Security vulnerability
**Mitigation:**
- Centralize role checks in service layer (never rely on UI hiding)
- Use decorators or explicit guards on all privileged methods
- Add comprehensive security tests
- Code review checklist for role enforcement

### Risk 4: Request State Management
**Risk:** Race conditions in concurrent approvals/rejections
**Impact:** Medium - Could result in double-decisions or inconsistent state
**Mitigation:**
- Use database-level constraints (CHECK status IN (...))
- Implement optimistic locking with updated_at checks
- Add integration tests for concurrent operations
- Consider using SELECT FOR UPDATE in critical sections

### Risk 5: Performance with Large Request History
**Risk:** Users with many requests could slow down UI
**Impact:** Low - Only affects power users
**Mitigation:**
- Implement pagination from the start
- Add limit/offset to all list queries
- Index on (user_id, submitted_at DESC)
- Consider archiving old requests in future phases
