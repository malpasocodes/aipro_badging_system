# AIPPRO Badging System

A Python/Streamlit application for recognizing and tracking student achievement through digital badges. The system supports identity verification, onboarding, role-based approvals, and progression from mini-badges to capstones.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfredessa/aippro-badging-system.git
   cd aippro-badging-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync --extra dev
   ```

3. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration (DATABASE_URL, ADMIN_EMAILS, etc.)
   ```

4. **Initialize database**
   ```bash
   uv run alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Install pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   uv run streamlit run app/main.py
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## üß™ Development Commands

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run coverage run -m pytest
uv run coverage report

# Run specific test types
uv run pytest tests/unit/          # Unit tests only
uv run pytest tests/integration/   # Integration tests only
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Linting and formatting
uv run ruff check .                # Check for issues
uv run ruff check --fix .          # Fix auto-fixable issues
uv run ruff format .               # Format code

# Type checking
uv run mypy app/

# Security scanning
uv run safety check               # Check for known vulnerabilities
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Format and check code (runs automatically with pre-commit)
uv run ruff format . && uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy app/

# Run tests before committing
uv run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

## üèóÔ∏è Phase-Based Development

This project follows a structured 10-phase development approach:

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Repo Initialization ‚úÖ
- [x] Python environment with uv package management
- [x] Complete project structure
- [x] CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [x] Development tooling configuration
- [x] Baseline documentation

### Phase 2A: Authentication & User Management ‚úÖ
- [x] Mock Google authentication system
- [x] User database with SQLite + Alembic migrations
- [x] Session management with timeout handling
- [x] Role-based access control (admin/student)
- [x] Admin bootstrap via environment variables
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage (15/15 tests passing)

### Phase 2B: Real Google OAuth Integration ‚úÖ **ACCEPTED**
- [x] Native Streamlit OAuth with st.login() and st.user
- [x] Google Identity Services integration
- [x] OAuth data synchronization with user database
- [x] Backward compatibility with mock authentication
- [x] Comprehensive OAuth testing (43/43 tests passing)
- [x] Complete OAuth setup documentation
- [x] Production-ready implementation with real credentials tested
- [x] Mock OAuth email conflict bug fixed

### Phase 2C: Enhanced Security (Planned)
- Advanced session security features
- CSRF protection and rate limiting
- Audit logging for authentication events

### Phase 3: User Onboarding & Registration ‚úÖ **ACCEPTED**
- [x] User registration form with username, Substack email, Meetup email
- [x] OnboardingService with comprehensive validation (RFC 5322 email, username rules)
- [x] Privacy policy and terms of service consent
- [x] Role-based routing to Admin/Assistant/Student dashboards
- [x] Admin role auto-sync based on ADMIN_EMAILS configuration
- [x] Database migration with onboarding_completed_at field

### Upcoming Phases
- Phase 4: Roles & Approvals Queue
- Phase 5: Badge Data Model & Catalog
- Phase 6: Earning Logic & Awards
- Phase 7: Notifications & Audit Trails
- Phase 8: Exports & PII Redaction
- Phase 9: UX Polish & Accessibility
- Phase 10: Deployment & Launch

Each phase requires formal planning, approval, and acceptance before proceeding. See `docs/plans/` for detailed phase documentation.

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **PII Redaction**: All exports automatically strip personally identifiable information
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Server-side enforcement of user permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all privileged operations
- **Secure Configuration**: Environment-based secrets management

## üß™ Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Services with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Data access layer against test database
- **Security Tests**: Role enforcement and PII redaction validation
- **Coverage Target**: 50% minimum (Phase 1), scaling to 80% by Phase 3-4
